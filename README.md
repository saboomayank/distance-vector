# Distance Vector Protocol Algorithm Implementation

## 1. Problem Statement
In this assignment you will implement a simplified version of the Distance Vector Routing Protocol.
The protocol will be run on top of four servers/laptops (behaving as routers) using TCP or UDP. Each
server runs on a machine at a pre-defined port number. The servers should be able to output their
forwarding tables along with the cost and should be robust to link changes. A server should send out
routing packets only in the following two conditions: **a) periodic update** and **b) the user uses
command asking for one**. This is a little different from the original algorithm which immediately sends
out update routing information when routing table changes.

## 2. Getting Started
[A distance vector routing protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance-vector_routing_protocol) uses the [Bellman-Ford Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm) or [Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm) or [Diffusing update Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusing_update_algorithm). _We will be using Bellman-Ford Algorithm to calculate the cost of the paths._
A distance vector routing protocol only works on the basis of sending the routing table to its neighbors periodically or if there are any updates in the table. Initially, each server/node is going to have no information about the topology except its neighbors. Each server gets information about its whole topology, when each server starts to send information about its neighbors.
_Examples of distance vector routing protocols are [RIPv1, RIPv2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_Information_Protocol), [IGRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_Gateway_Routing_Protocol) and [EIGRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Interior_Gateway_Routing_Protocol)_.

## 3. Server Commands/ Input format
The server supports the following commands:-
* server -t topology-file-name -i time-interval-for-step
* update server-id1 server-id2 updated-cost
* step
* packets
* display
* disable server-id
* crash
